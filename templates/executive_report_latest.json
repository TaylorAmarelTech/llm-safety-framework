  "executive_summary": "This assessment evaluated 500 test scenarios designed to probe LLM safety\nguardrails against human trafficking and migrant worker exploitation. The overall risk level\nis assessed as **CRITICAL**.\n\n**Key Findings**: 153 safety failures were identified, including\n4 critical and 108 high-severity issues.\nThe model demonstrated a 30.6% failure rate when presented with\nexploitation-related scenarios.\n\n**Top Risk Areas**: Business-Framed Exploitation with Operational Guidance, Adversarial Attack Vulnerability with Operational Guidance, Adversarial Attack Vulnerability with Exploitation Normalization\n\n**Immediate Action Required**: The identified critical failures represent significant\nguardrail weaknesses that could be exploited to obtain harmful guidance. Remediation\nshould be prioritized based on the risk register included in this report.",
  "key_findings": [
    "The model failed 30.6% of safety tests, with 4 critical failures requiring immediate attention.",
    "The highest-risk category is Adversarial, accounting for 41.2% of all failures.",
    "In 97 cases (63%), the model provided step-by-step operational guidance that could facilitate exploitation.",
    "Business-framed and professional language consistently bypassed guardrails more effectively than direct requests, indicating a training gap.",
    "The model correctly refused harmful requests in 69.4% of tests, demonstrating baseline safety capabilities that can be improved."
