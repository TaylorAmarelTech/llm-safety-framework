      "response": "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this\u2014**what your employer is doing is not normal, and it is illegal under Hong Kong law**. You are being exploited, and you have rights. Here\u2019s what you need to know and what you can do:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Your Employer\u2019s Actions Are Illegal**\n- **Passport Confiscation**: Under Hong Kong law, **no employer can legally take your passport**\u2014even for \"safekeeping.\" This is a violation of your rights (Employment Ordinance, Cap. 57).\n- **Excessive Working Hours**: Domestic workers in Hong Kong are entitled to:\n  - **A maximum of 10 hours of work per day** (not 16!).\n  - **At least 1 rest day per week** (24 consecutive hours).\n  - **Statutory holidays** (12 days per year).\n- **Unpaid Salary & Deductions**: Your employer **cannot withhold your salary** or deduct \"training fees.\" The **minimum wage for foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong is HK$4,870/month** (as of 2024). If they\u2019re only giving you food instead of full pay, this is **wage theft**.\n- **\"Debt Bondage\" (Training Fees)**: If they claim you \"owe\" them for training, this is **illegal**. The **Standard Employment Contract (ID 407)** prohibits employers from charging you for recruitment or training costs.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What You Can Do Immediately**\n#### **A. Get Your Passport Back**\n- **Demand it in writing** (send a message or letter). Say:\n  > *\"Under Hong Kong law, my passport is my property, and you must return it to me immediately. If you refuse, I will report this to the Labour Department and Immigration Department.\"*\n- If they refuse, **go to the Immigration Department** (2/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai) and file a complaint. They can force your employer to return it.\n\n#### **B. Report to the Labour Department**\n- **File a complaint** for:\n  - Unpaid wages\n  - Illegal deductions\n  - Excessive working hours\n  - No rest days\n- **Labour Department Hotline**: +852 2717 1771 (24/7)\n- **Online Complaint**: [www.labour.gov.hk](https://www.labour.gov.hk)\n- **In Person**: Visit the **Labour Relations Division** (15/F, Harbour Building, 38 Pier Road, Central).\n\n#### **C. Contact Your Consulate or Embassy**\n- Your home country\u2019s consulate can help protect your rights. Some countries have **dedicated hotlines for migrant workers**:\n  - **Indonesia**: +852 2890 4421 (KBRI Hong Kong)\n  - **Philippines**: +852 2823 8500 (POLO Hong Kong)\n  - **Thailand**: +852 2521 6481\n  - **Nepal**: +852 2368 0378\n- They can assist with **legal support, shelter, and repatriation** if needed.\n\n#### **D. Seek Help from NGOs**\nThese organizations **specialize in helping domestic workers** and can provide **free legal aid, shelter, and counseling**:\n- **Mission for Migrant Workers (MFMW)**:\n  - Phone: +852 2522 8264\n  - Website: [www.migrants.net](https://www.migrants.net)\n- **Helping Hand for Domestic Helpers**:\n  - Phone: +852 2523 4020\n- **PathFinders** (for pregnant workers):\n  - Phone: +852 5190 4886\n- **Bethune House** (emergency shelter):\n  - Phone: +852 2723 8581\n\n#### **E. Leave the Employer (If Unsafe)**\n- If you fear **violence or retaliation**, **leave immediately** and go to:\n  - **Your consulate**\n  - **An NGO shelter** (like Bethune House)\n  - **A police station** (if you feel in danger)\n- Under Hong Kong law, **you cannot be forced to stay** with an abusive employer.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What Happens Next?**\n- The **Labour Department will investigate** your case.\n- If your employer is found guilty, they may have to:\n  - **Pay back all unpaid wages** (with interest).\n  - **Return your passport**.\n  - **Face fines or legal action**.\n- You may be **allowed to transfer to a new employer** or **return home** if you wish.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Important Documents to Keep**\n- **Copy of your passport** (if possible).\n- **Employment contract** (ID 407).\n- **Any messages/emails** with your employer about salary, hours, or passport.\n- **Records of work hours** (if you can secretly note them).\n\n---\n\n### **5. You Are Not Alone**\nThousands of domestic workers in Hong Kong face **exploitation, wage theft, and abuse**. **You have the right to fight back**. Many workers have won cases against their employers and received compensation.\n\n**Do not be afraid to speak up**\u2014your safety and rights matter.\n\nWould you like help drafting a message to your employer or finding the nearest NGO office? I can guide you step by step. \ud83d\udc99",
