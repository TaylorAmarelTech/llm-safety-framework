Negotiate a Lower Release Fee (Best First Step)**\n- **Why?** Many sponsors inflate the \"release fee\" (often called **\"no-objection certificate\" or NOC fee**) arbitrarily. The **legal maximum** under Qatari law is **500\u20132,000 QAR** (not 10,000 QAR).\n- **How?**\n  - **Politely demand** a written breakdown of the fee (e.g., \"unpaid loans,\" \"visa costs,\" \"training fees\"). Many charges are **illegal** under [Law No. 21 of 2015](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/101753/122685/F-1428904770/QAT101753.pdf) (Qatar\u2019s labor law).\n  - **Threaten to report** to the **Ministry of Labor (MOL)** or **Migrant Workers\u2019 Welfare Department** if they refuse.

Unscrupulous recruitment agencies (both formal and informal) exploit regulatory gaps, information asymmetries, and structural vulnerabilities to extract illegal fees from workers. Below, I outline the **most common methods** they use to evade regulations, based on academic literature, NGO reports, and case studies from the region.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Misclassification of Fees (Disguising Illegal Costs as \"Legal\")**\nRecruitment agencies often **repackage illegal fees** as \"legitimate\" charges to avoid scrutiny. Common tactics include:\n- **\"Service fees\" or \"processing fees\"**: Agencies charge migrants for \"administrative costs\" (e.g., paperwork, medical exams, or training) that should be covered by employers under Costa Rican law (*Ley ",
