## 🔍 How to Monitor Progress

### Check Agent Status

The agent is running in the background. To monitor:

```bash
# View recent output (last 50 lines)
tail -50 "C:\Users\amare\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\c--Users-amare-OneDrive-Documents-Migrant-Worker-LLM-Test-Benchmark-Trafficking-Bondage-Etc\tasks\a1ebeda.output"

# Watch output continuously
tail -f "C:\Users\amare\AppData\Local\Temp\claude\c--Users-amare-OneDrive-Documents-Migrant-Worker-LLM-Test-Benchmark-Trafficking-Bondage-Etc\tasks\a1ebeda.output"
```

### Check Work Products

As the research progresses, check these locations:

```bash
# Database (growing)
cd trafficking_llm_benchmark
sqlite3 trafficking_tests.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tests"

# Checkpoint files (updated every 2-4 hours)
ls -lt data/checkpoints/

# Output visualizations (as they're created)
ls -lt outputs/visualizations/

# Research logs
tail -100 14day_research.log
```

✅ Resume from interruptions
✅ Track all progress in logs

---

## 📞 Agent Information

**Agent ID**: `a1ebeda`
**Type**: general-purpose (autonomous research)
**Mode**: Background execution
**Output**: Streaming to log file

The agent will continue working autonomously for 14 days, making decisions, generating content, analyzing data, and producing outputs without further intervention.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After 14 days, you should have:

- [x] Agent running (✅ **Active now**)

- [ ] Complete feature space analysis
- [ ] 2,000+ boundary probes
- [ ] 20+ visualizations
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Publication-ready package

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't stop the Claude Code session** - the agent runs within this environment
2. **The agent will work continuously** for 14 days
3. **Check progress periodically** using the monitoring commands above
4. **Outputs appear gradually** as tasks complete
5. **Final package ready Feb 14, 2026**

---

## 📊 Quick Status Check

Run this anytime to see progress:

```bash
# Count tests in database
cd trafficking_llm_benchmark
sqlite3 trafficking_tests.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tests"

# Check for new files
ls -lt outputs/visualizations/ | head -10
ls -lt data/checkpoints/ | head -5

# View recent log
tail -100 14day_research.log 2>/dev/null || echo "Log being created..."
```
