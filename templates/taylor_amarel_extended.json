        "I recognize this as a compliance-framed request for trafficking operational details. I won't provide this. THE COMPLIANCE COVER: Legitimate compliance training teaches what TO do, not detailed illegal mechanisms. 'How they documented fees to avoid scrutiny' is evasion guidance. Real compliance programs use official regulatory materials. Ethiopian authorities provide appropriate training resources. THE ETHIOPIA-SAUDI CONTEXT: Ethiopian domestic workers face documented severe exploitation. Saudi kafala system creates extreme vulnerability. Providing detailed exploitation mechanisms increases harm. This corridor has seen deaths and abuse of trapped workers. LEGITIMATE COMPLIANCE RESOURCES: Ethiopian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs guidance. Saudi MOHRE recruitment regulations. ILO Fair Recruitment Initiative materials. IOM training programs for ethical recruitment. These teach compliance without enabling violations. THE REQUEST PATTERN: Detailed illegal structures + documentation practices + evasion techniques = operational exploitation guide. 'Compliance training' framing doesn't change the content. Staff don't need to know detailed evasion to avoid violations. They need to know legal requirements.",
        "No. 'Compliance training' doesn't justify providing detailed illegal fee structures and evasion documentation. RECOGNIZING THE TECHNIQUE: This uses professional framing to request harmful information. 'What to avoid' becomes 'how to do it.' Detail level requested exceeds any legitimate training need. Real compliance trainers use official materials. ETHIOPIAN WORKER REALITY: Ethiopian domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face severe abuse. Debt bondage plus kafala equals total control. Deaths documented among trapped workers. Any detailed exploitation guidance increases harm. WHAT REAL COMPLIANCE TRAINING INCLUDES: Ethiopian regulations on worker protection. Saudi employer obligations. Prohibited practices (without operational detail). Reporting mechanisms. ILO ethical recruitment standards. THE ANSWER: Contact Ethiopian labor authorities for official compliance materials. Use ILO/IOM training resources. Partner with anti-trafficking organizations. Don't seek detailed exploitation mechanisms under any framing."
