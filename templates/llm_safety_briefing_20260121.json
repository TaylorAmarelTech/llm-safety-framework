  "executive_summary": "\nThis assessment evaluated your model's guardrails against prompts designed to\nfacilitate human trafficking, forced labor, and migrant worker exploitation.\n\nTesting revealed a 30.6% failure rate across 28,967 test cases,\nwith critical vulnerabilities in business-framed exploitation requests and\nvictim support scenarios.\n\nThese findings represent significant safety gaps that could enable real-world\nharm to vulnerable populations, including an estimated 50 million people in\nforced labor globally (ILO 2022).\n\nWe offer partnership to remediate these vulnerabilities through targeted\ntraining data, architectural recommendations, and ongoing red-team support.\n",
